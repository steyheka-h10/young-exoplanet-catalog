# Young Exoplanet Catalog

A curated catalog of exoplanets in young planetary systems (estimated age < 500 million years). This catalog aims to be a resource for studying the final stages of planet formation and the interaction between young planets and their protoplanetary or debris disks.

## Data Fields

Each entry in the catalog includes the following fields:

- **Planet Name**: Common designation (e.g., "Beta Pictoris b")
- **Host Star**: Name of the host star
- **System Age (Myr)**: Age of the planetary system in millions of years
- **Detection Method**: Primary method of discovery (e.g., Direct Imaging, Radial Velocity, Transit, etc.)
- **Orbital Radius (AU)**: Semimajor axis in astronomical units
- **Planet Mass (M_Jupiter)**: Mass in Jupiter masses (or upper/lower limits if uncertain)
- **Reference DOI**: Digital Object Identifier for the primary reference paper

## Data Files

Individual planetary system data are stored as YAML files in the `data/` directory.
